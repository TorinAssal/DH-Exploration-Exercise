I figure that I'll throw in my exit ticket in here alongside the rest of this, just to make it more condensed and easier to manage:

Before I started in this class, I only had a basic understanding of digital history's importance and the unseen factors of labor and transformation that are left undocumented, with the hope of building those experiences into my understanding and other curriculum for my general studies. Being exposed to the different technologies through the tutorials was quite eye-opening even if I was only following the newcomer course- they're tools I'm glad I now have an awareness of, but I'm in a position where I don't think I'll use them until I find a use for them, which I think makes sense!

I think overall, I quantify a lot of my success with being able to relate my current knowledge to what I'm being exposed to through my courses, and build on that pre-existing oundation with the parts I can see myself using. I know that I may not do as well as others might want me to in this course or others for that mater, but I feel content in having experienced, learned, and built upon my existing knowledge and toolkit. I never had any *crazy* failures, but I did have quite a few hiccups over the course of doing the tutorials, particularly with the programs that scrap and involve using your computer and coding terminals- something about them just overwhelms my brain @w@
For this last little exercise, I honestly am feeling a little too worn out to really push into it as much as I maybe could have, but I am glad that I gave it at least some time and effort attempting to connect it to one of my interests- I hope that it correlates with the expectations of the assignment, since I'm really not trying to reach for much with it beyond what has been asked- the sumer heat is cooking me  ^^

I do think a lot of what I've learned will have some form of application into my other courses, especially the latter two tutorials of part three I did, Storymapjs and Twine- as a sucker for storytelling that really enjoys seeing the different mediums that it can take, I would not be surprised if I built initial frameworks or assets for some of my creative projects within them!
I think for me, this course served to reinforce ideas and concepts I had already been broadly familiar with and applied it into a more specific context, which I like- I really enjoy those biger nuggets of information for that reason, since they're kinda like jawbreakers or other hard candies- you get a feel for the shape in your mouth, the initial taste, the rigidity of it, with the longer it sits in your mouth the softer it gets, before you can finally crush it with your teeth! A bit of a disgusting analogy I came up with on the fly I know, but I thin it works well to explain what this course and other broader discussions that then delve into specifics work towards!
I think I got as much out of this course as I was willing to put in, and that to me is satisfying enough- being exposed to new tools, ways of thinking, and considering new perspectives when thinking about digital ephemera and other online components we otherwise take for granted! Thank you very much for creating such an engaging course, I've learned a lot and built on what I already know from it <3
