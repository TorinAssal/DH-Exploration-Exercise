The 'log' is a scratch pad where you jot down observations, problems, solutions, links that help you, anything really, as you work through the relevant tutorials. **It is ok if you get stuck** when doing the tutorials; your log is what enables me to help you overcome the challenges. Your log gives me a glimpse into your workflow and practice. Hit the pencil icon to edit this document.

It can be helpful to drag-and-drop screenshots of your work when you hit an error. On a mac, hit cmd + 4 to highlight the area of the screen you want to screenshot; on a Windows machine, you can hit the windows key + g to do the same thing. Drag and drop the screenshot into this folder. You can embed the image into this text file by following this pattern:

`![](the-screenshot-filename.png)`

Once you hit the 'commit' button, Github will embed the image. **nb** nothing saves unless you hit the commit button.

## Log for Part Four

So, what I'm thinkng of doing for this final part of the course is looking at a large archive of data and media artifacts I mentioned in one of my previous reflections, called the Biomedia Project (link to the archive is here: https://biomediaproject.com/bmp/), since it relates to something that I'm interested in and I thought could make for an effective motivator to relate some of the tutorials I've completed for this course into it! It's not so much a traditional data set as it is a collection of different pieces of data and digital ephemera (alongside physical artifacts transferred into an online format), so I think I'll likely be focusing on the hypothetical connections this projects collected information could have with some of the different tutorials and programs of the course!

**Voyant**
So, some of the ways I see Voyant being used effectively yto chart the data within this larger database could be in locating certain keywords to identify underlying messaging or the relevance of certain products, the frequency or quantity of a certain form of media artifact (number of books/serializations, films, among others), and then engineering a corpus to potentially highlight what the primary methods of messaging were- since Lego has generally been the interests of children, this lego theme might have more connections to a young adult audience as the years progress, both in terms of the way those artifacts and data presents the information from the artifacts- there'd likely be a lot of proper nouns and names scraped from it as a result, but I think generally this could almost behave like a more statistical and numerical analysis of these many different media texts and artifacts, allowing for a deeper reading not only into their underlying messages but also how the messages they present might change over time! A lot of this is connecting back to my interest in my program of communication and media studies, and I think for that latter facet of it, using Voyant to scrap and scrub keywords from these media artifacts (alongside some manual dissemination for certain pieces) could make for a very rich database and corpus!

**Storymapjs**
The cool thing about trying to dissect and organize some of these different forms of media components is that there are a number of different maps present within it's story and other facets! With that in mind, I could see there being a form of storymap focusing on the different regions within the story or setting, providing those historical details in-universe! In fact, if my memory serves (and since this project has archived versions of the Bionicle theme's old websites), I wouldn't be surprised if there is already some form of map exploration tool like storymaps available! In that case, I think that could mean that transcribing the information to storymaps could make it work better and potentially used any information or knowledge added in addendum to better contextualize it for a reader and the universe itself!

**Twine**
I think the reason I believe Twine could also work in exploring this repository of data is that there does exist a well known point and click adventure game similar to the formats of Twine itself, with added visual elements and more varied gameplay of course. With it, I could see a player being able to experience the different kinds of advertising and media artifacts of Bionicle and this archive, moving between audiovisual, to print, and then into sculptures or other forms of documented ephemera! Being able to interact with the project as it exists currently I think could also work just as feasible, and there are already a few different forms of documentation and organization of it's story (link here! https://thegreatarchives.com)in comparison to the broader spectrum of the different and varied media artifacts I'm discussing.

I figure that I'll throw in my exit ticket in here alongside the rest of this, just to make it more condensed and easier to manage:

Before I started in this class, I only had a basic understanding of digital history's importance and the unseen factors of labor and transformation that are left undocumented, with the hope of building those experiences into my understanding and other curriculum for my general studies. Being exposed to the different technologies through the tutorials was quite eye-opening even if I was only following the newcomer course- they're tools I'm glad I now have an awareness of, but I'm in a position where I don't think I'll use them until I find a use for them, which I think makes sense!

I think overall, I quantify a lot of my success with being able to relate my current knowledge to what I'm being exposed to through my courses, and build on that pre-existing oundation with the parts I can see myself using. I know that I may not do as well as others might want me to in this course or others for that mater, but I feel content in having experienced, learned, and built upon my existing knowledge and toolkit. I never had any *crazy* failures, but I did have quite a few hiccups over the course of doing the tutorials, particularly with the programs that scrap and involve using your computer and coding terminals- something about them just overwhelms my brain @w@
For this last little exercise, I honestly am feeling a little too worn out to really push into it as much as I maybe could have, but I am glad that I gave it at least some time and effort attempting to connect it to one of my interests- I hope that it correlates with the expectations of the assignment, since I'm really not trying to reach for much with it beyond what has been asked- the sumer heat is cooking me  ^^

I do think a lot of what I've learned will have some form of application into my other courses, especially the latter two tutorials of part three I did, Storymapjs and Twine- as a sucker for storytelling that really enjoys seeing the different mediums that it can take, I would not be surprised if I built initial frameworks or assets for some of my creative projects within them!
I think for me, this course served to reinforce ideas and concepts I had already been broadly familiar with and applied it into a more specific context, which I like- I really enjoy those biger nuggets of information for that reason, since they're kinda like jawbreakers or other hard candies- you get a feel for the shape in your mouth, the initial taste, the rigidity of it, with the longer it sits in your mouth the softer it gets, before you can finally crush it with your teeth! A bit of a disgusting analogy I came up with on the fly I know, but I thin it works well to explain what this course and other broader discussions that then delve into specifics work towards!
I think I got as much out of this course as I was willing to put in, and that to me is satisfying enough- being exposed to new tools, ways of thinking, and considering new perspectives when thinking about digital ephemera and other online components we otherwise take for granted! Thank you very much for creating such an engaging course, I've learned a lot and built on what I already know from it <3
